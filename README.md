This is a simple makefile. The makefile is present in the working directory and when we type make in the terminal it compiles the program and stores the object files generated in the obj directory and the executable in the "bin" directory. The programs "main.c" "file_1.c" are present in the "src" directory and the header files (.h) are present in the "inc" directory. Using make clean will remove all the object files and the executables.
This makefile uses a static library stored in the lib folder.
